      Assignment: Final Project
      As stated on the syllabus, 20% of your final grade is based
      on your "Project". This is more than just another Assignment.
      It requires use of your design skills. Choose a project that
      you are interested in doing. The main thing is to learn and
      to have fun doing it. Come up with an innovative idea related
      to the course material. Think of some dynamic behavior you
      would like to add to a webpage and apply JavaScript concepts
      and techniques to design and implement it. The total time
      spent on the project - including research, design, coding,
      testing, redesign, etc., must be at least 20 hours.
